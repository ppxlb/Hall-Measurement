# Hall-Measurement
Collecting and analysing hall measurements with a bio-rad hall measurement system

Requires NumPy and PyVISA modules to run arrays and GPIB communication respectively.

4 files, 3 of which are simply functions collected into 1 "main" execution script.

Will only run whilst connected to the bio-rad HL5200 system with a GPIB.
