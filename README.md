# Hall-Measurement
Collecting and analysing hall measurements with a bio-rad hall measurement system

Requires NumPy, SciPy, Sleep, DateTime and PyVISA modules in addition to any NI visa drivers.

MAIN_FUNC.pyw contains the core execution of the GUI allowing measurements to be taken with other modules needed for specific tasks.

When connected to the instrument simply run the "MAIN_FUNC.pyw" with Python.

Will only run whilst connected to the bio-rad HL5200 system with a GPIB.

Python 3.6
